# FrostyNick Website 2023

*Finally* released the website! I'll work on it more on my spare time. Much to do.

#### Tasks accomplished so far:

- When pressing <kbd>ctrl + s</kbd>, it will update with the live server and parse the markdown automatically when `live-server` from npm and `main.sh` from here are ran at the same time.
- `CSS` is much better than before.
- Basic layout is set.
